# Hosting & Maintenance

### Where is my site hosted?

The websites we build with Framer are hosted through Framer. They use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host the website ([https://www.framer.com/help/articles/guide-to-framer-hosting-infrastructure](https://www.framer.com/help/articles/guide-to-framer-hosting-infrastructure/)). They handle the performance of the server and generate free SSL certificates for every website hosted through them.

### Whatâ€™s included in your maintenance?

Our maintenance package covers 10 core services. This includes site health checks, SEO and performance tweaks, looking for broken links, accessibility issues and security vulnerabilities. You can find out more about it in our [blog post](https://www.80five.co.uk/news/10-essential-website-maintenance-services-every-business-needs) or by downloading our [free ebook](https://www.80five.co.uk/ebooks).

We strongly recommend you include a website monitoring plan with [UpWatch](https://www.upwatch.co.uk/) as part of the website maintenance so that more data can be used to guide the ongoing maintenance.

### How to request changes or updates

Every month, you can get access to one hour of website updates. This can include adding new blog posts, updating service descriptions, refreshing images, or modifying existing text.

To request help, contact us via our [email address](https://www.80five.co.uk/contact).

### How backups and security are handled

Website backups are handled via Framer and their hosting service. We do also keep an offline copy of your website through Figma. By default, websites hosted via Framer are very secure. However, we run additional security checks and scans.

### What happens if my site goes down?

If you have added website monitoring via UpWatch, we will know as soon as there is an issue and we can usually resolve most issues without needing to inform you. Without UpWatch, you will need to purchase you own website monitoring and alert us if there is an issue.

### Cancelling a hosting & maintenance plan

You can cancel any hosting and maintenance plan at any time. We will not be able to reimburse you for any payments already taken that month, but we can cancel any future payments immediately. You will then need to find new hosting quickly.

If you just want to cancel the maintenance, that can be done immediately and no future payments taken. You just need to contact us via email.
