# Website Monitoring

### What is UpWatch?

[UpWatch](https://www.upwatch.co.uk/) is a website monitoring service that we own and operate as a standalone business. It's primary objective is to provide comprehensive website monitoring that ensures no website issue can go unnoticed.

### What types of monitoring are included?

UpWatch provides seven website monitors for every customer:

1. Uptime monitoring
2. SSL expiration monitoring
3. Domain expiration monitoring
4. Visual change monitoring
5. DNS change monitoring
6. Page speed monitoring
7. Site health reporting

You can find out more on the [Products](https://www.upwatch.co.uk/products) page of UpWatch's website.

### How to access your monitoring dashboard

We/UpWatch provides a dashboard that you can log into to see the status of your website or to add additional websites. The dashboard can be found at [https://app.upwatch.co.uk](https://app.upwatch.co.uk).

### What to do if you get an alert

Any alert is first sent to us/UpWatch. We will check the validity of any alert to be sure it is not a false alert. We will then investigate to understand the cause and solution to the issue. We will then send you an alert via multiple communication methods and endeavour to tell you what the issue is, why it has occurred and how it can be resolved.

### How to add/remove a monitored website

Every website is charged the same flat rate per month. Additional websites can be added to each account via the [dashboard](https://app.upwatch.co.uk).

### What does it cost and how do you pay?

There are three plans, Basic for £5 per month, Standard for £10 per month and Premium for £15 per month. You can read more about what each plan provides on the [Pricing](https://www.upwatch.co.uk/pricing) page of the UpWatch website.

All payments are taken monthly via Stripe. However, if you are a hosting and maintenance client with 80five, the cost per month is added into your single hosting and maintenance monthly fee and charged as a direct debit via GoCardless.

### How do you cancel a plan?

To cancel a plan, you need to get in touch with us or UpWatch via the available [contact](https://www.upwatch.co.uk/contact) methods.
