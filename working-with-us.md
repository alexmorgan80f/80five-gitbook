# Working With Us

### Project timelines and typical durations

The timeline for each project can vary significantly. It will depend on many factors, such as the amount of pages, the features required on the website, etc. It is also dependent on how quickly you can respond to messages and requests for content.

We do not take on work that we are not certain we can complete in a timely manner.

### How we communicate

We will primarily contact you via email or phone. We can meet via Zoom, if required.

### How to give useful feedback

When we provide you with access to wireframes, mockups or prototype websites, we welcome your feedback. It is important, though, that the feedback is a clear and precise as possible to reduce the chance of mistakes.

### Invoicing and payments

We will invoice you asking for 10% upfront before a project begins. We will then ask for 50% of the remaining balance before the final website is built and designs are agreed and the remaining 40% on completion.

Payments for hosting and maintenance are taken monthly via GoCardless.
