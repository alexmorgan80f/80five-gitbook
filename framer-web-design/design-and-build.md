# Design & Build

Next, we will build a prototype using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). This will be a very good representation of what the website could look like and how it would function. Figma will not allow us to get a perfect representation of all aspects of the end website, but it works as a good visual tool for discussions.

We can then tweak the design to suit your requirements. Once you are happy with the overall design, we will ask for 50% payment before we move forwards to the full build.

Finally, we move to Framer. At this point we will build the final Figma design as a fully-functional website. This will have interactions, animations and all working features.

The website can be previewed on a staging URL. This can be shared with employees, friends, families and trusted customers to help get feedback.

We can iterate and make changes.

The last step is to get the website live. We recommend that your domain be connected to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/), which we can help with. This will mean that in under 5 minutes, we can press some buttons and get the new website live!
