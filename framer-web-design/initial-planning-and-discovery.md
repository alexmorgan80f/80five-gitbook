# Initial Planning & Discovery

All great projects start from an initial meeting. Once you have [reached out to us](https://www.80five.co.uk/contact), we will book a time for a phone call or a Zoom call to discuss your business and your new website.

It is important during this discovery phase that we can learn as much as possible about both your business and what you want your website to do for you and your business. Due to this, I would recommend you spend some time writing down some ideas of your goals and expectations.

During our discovery call we will take the time to talk to each other and plan things out.

At this point, and if you are happy to continue, we will provide a project brief. The brief will include costs and, once you are happy with the brief and the costs, we will ask for a 10% deposit.
