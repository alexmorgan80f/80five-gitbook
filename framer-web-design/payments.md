# Payments

For the website build proces, we take three payments:

1. 10% at the start of the project
2. 50% when the design in Figma is signed-off
3. 40% when the website goes live

Failure to pay invoices will mean that the project pauses or the website is taken down.

All payments are taken via GoCardless.
