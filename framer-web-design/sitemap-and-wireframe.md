# Sitemap & Wireframe

As we move forwards, the next phase is to visually plan the website. We will take the time to learn more about your industry, your competitors and assess your requirements.

We will then create a sitemap. This is a flow diagram that maps out all of the pages on your new website and how they connect to each other.

With the sitemap, we will also create a wireframe. This is a blueprint for your website (although it is grey in colour!). It will provide an idea of where there will be text, images, buttons and more. Wireframes can be hard to understand and often people just want to move on to seeing a 'real' website, so we won't press you too much if you are not learning too much from the wireframe.
