# Troubleshooting

### My website isn’t loading – what to check first

It is best to check your website on different devices and, if possible, with and without mobile internet, just to rule out device or WiFi issues on your end.

If you have signed up to UpWatch, we will notify you as soon as we are aware and make diagnosed any issues on your website.

If you have not received an alert from us, but are certain there is an issue, please contact us immediately.

### I can’t log into Framer

Framer does not use a password as a means of logging in. You go to the Framer website, or via this [direct link](https://login.framer.com/). You will enter your email address and they will send you a link via your email account's inbox. Do check you spam folder.

Alternatively, if you have a Google/Gmail account. Use their option to sign in with your Google account, as this is much quicker.
